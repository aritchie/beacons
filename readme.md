## HOW TO USE

### Ranging for Beacons

    var scanner = BeaconService.Instance.Scan().Subscribe(scanResult => {
        // do something with it
    });

    scanner.Dispose(); // to stop scanning

### Background Monitoring for Beacons

Once you have successfully scanned for a device, use the instance

    Device.WhenServicesDiscovered().Subscribe(service => 
    {
        service.W
    });

## FAQ

* Q) Why is everything reactive instead of events/async

  A) I wanted event streams as I was scanning devices.  I also wanted to throttle things like characteristic notification feeds.  Lastly, was the proper cleanup of events and resources.
